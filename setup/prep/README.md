# Setting up your Computer for the Intro to Webapps Tutorial

We will be using docker to build and run this tutorial, this will mean you won't have to install much stuff on to your computer and you'll be able to easily remove it in time.

Before coming to the session please could you install Docker on to your laptop using the below instructions, it will mean we can start on the session quickly without needing to wait for everyone to install it.

- [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
- [OSX](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
- [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)

Alternatively, you can just install golang and git on to your laptop, but that will require more configuration and it has not been tested thoroughly.  We won't be able to help you much if you decide to go down this route.  The docker method is preferred as it ensures everyone has the same common environment to work with.
