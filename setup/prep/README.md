# Setting up your Computer for the Intro to Webapps Tutorial

We will be using docker to build and run this tutorial, this will mean you won't have to install much stuff on to your computer and you'll be able to easily remove it in time.

Before coming to the session please could you install Docker and download the container image on to your laptop using the below instructions, it will mean we can start on the session quickly without needing to wait for everyone to download and install it which could take a long time.


1. Install Docker - You may need to setup an account on docker.com to download
	- [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
	- [OSX](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
	- [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)

1. Download the container image
	Run the below command which will download the container image, ready for the tutorial.
	- `docker pull golang:buster`

---

Alternatively, you can just install golang and git on to your laptop, but that will require more configuration and it has not been tested thoroughly.  We won't be able to help you much if you decide to go down this route.  The docker method is preferred as it ensures everyone has the same common environment to work with.

Please also keep an eye on this page incase there are other things you need to prepare before the day.
